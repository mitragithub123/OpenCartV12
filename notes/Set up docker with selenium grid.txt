Here are the steps to set up and use Docker with Selenium Grid on Windows:

Download and Install Docker Desktop:
Visit the Docker Desktop installation page for Windows.
Download Docker Desktop for Windows (x86_64).
Install Docker Desktop and restart your computer if prompted.
Open Docker Desktop to complete the installation.
Check the docker vesion: docker version/ docker -v (in cmd)

Start Docker Services:
Go to Windows > Services > Docker Desktop Services.
Start the Docker Desktop Services.

Pull Selenium Docker Images:
Open Command Prompt (cmd) and run the following commands to pull the necessary Docker images:
docker pull selenium/hub
docker pull selenium/node-chrome
docker pull selenium/node-firefox

Configure Docker Compose:
Place the docker-compose.yaml file in your Eclipse project directory.

docker-compose.yaml
--------------------
services:
  selenium-hub:
    image: selenium/hub
    ports:
      - "4444:4444" # Maps the host's port 4444 to the container's port 4444
    networks:
      - grid

  node-chrome:
    image: selenium/node-chrome
    environment:
      - SE_EVENT_BUS_HOST=selenium-hub
      - SE_EVENT_BUS_PUBLISH_PORT=4442
      - SE_EVENT_BUS_SUBSCRIBE_PORT=4443
    depends_on:
      - selenium-hub # Ensures the hub starts before the node
    networks:
      - grid

  node-firefox:
    image: selenium/node-firefox
    environment:
      - SE_EVENT_BUS_HOST=selenium-hub
      - SE_EVENT_BUS_PUBLISH_PORT=4442
      - SE_EVENT_BUS_SUBSCRIBE_PORT=4443
    depends_on:
      - selenium-hub # Ensures the hub starts before the node
    networks:
      - grid

networks:
  grid:
    driver: bridge
--------------------------

Run Docker Compose:
Open Command Prompt in the directory where docker-compose.yaml is located.
Execute the command:
docker-compose up

Verify Selenium Grid:
Open Chrome and navigate to: http://localhost:4444/grid/console ( Get this from Docker Desktop)
This page will show the status of the Selenium Grid hub and nodes.

Scale the Number of Nodes:
To increase the number of Chrome nodes, run:
docker-compose scale chrome=3

Run Your TestNG Tests:
Run your TestNG XML file and ensure that remote is selected in your config.properties file.

Stop and Clean Up:
To stop the Selenium Grid and remove the created containers, run:
docker-compose down

-------------
Navigate to the Directory Containing the grid JAR File
Open cmd here
In cmd
java -jar selenium-server-4.23.1.jar standalone
A Url will be generated
http://192.168.2.173:4444 (Open this in browser)
Match this url in BaseTest
Run testng.xml

To stop server, in cmd: CTRL+C
